            <h2><em><u>What is Climate Change?</u></em></h2>
            <p>
                The term <b><span style="color: rgb(126, 188, 232);">climate change</span></b> refers to long-term
                shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. It can
                also be referred
                to as 'The Climate Crisis'.
            </p>

            <p>
                The climate crisis being an universal issue between countries and continents.
                This topic has been discussed among scientists and environmentalists for years
                and will continue to be discussed for many more...
            </p>

            <p>
                The effects of climate change will
                become irreversible if something is not done soon to reverse the effects. Since 1880,
                Earth’s temperature has risen by an average of 0.14° F. per decade (Lindsey and Dahlman).
            </p>

            <p>
                The 10 warmest years that exist in the historical record have all occurred since 2010.

            <summary>Factors of Climate Change</summary>
            <h2><em><u>What Factors Play Into Climate Change?</u></em></h2>
            <p>
                There are several different factors that play into climate change.
                These factors include: <b>CO2 Emissions, Methane Emissions, and Deforestation</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our final project investigates a deeper analysis of the top three factors of climate change and the
                effects they have on the <b>global temperature</b>.

            </p>

            <h3><em><u> <span style="color: rgb(234, 215, 93);">CO2 Emissions</span></u></em></h3>
            <p>
                Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the top greenhouse gas that is emitted naturally through the carbon cycle, and
                through
                activities such as: the burning of fossil fuels, solid wastes, wood
                products, and can also be a result of chemical reactions.
            </p>

            <p>
                The dataset used for this project was: <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/co2-emissions-by-country"
                    target="_blank">CO2 Emissions</a>.
            </p>

            <h3><em><u> <span style="color: rgb(243, 164, 85);">Methane Emissions</span></u></em></h3>
            <p>
                Methane emissions stem from the production and transportation of coal, natural gas, and oil.
                Methane emissions can also be a result of livestock and other agricultural practices that are done.
                Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, coming in more potent than CO2 emissions. This
                being said
                , there exists less methane emissions than CO2 emissions in the atmosphere.
            </p>

                    target="_blank">Methane Emissions Across The World (1990-2018)</a>.
            </p>

            <h3><em><u> <span style="color: rgb(125, 178, 105);">Deforestation Rates</span></u></em></h3>
            <p>
                Deforestation can also be a causing factor to producing CO2 emissions and methane emissions.
                Deforestation and forest degradation is responsible
                for 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions (WWF). The number one cause for deforestation comes from
                expansions in agriculture.

            </p>

            <h3><em><u> <span style="color: rgb(191, 114, 114);">Global Temperature</span></u></em></h3>
            <p>
                Earth’s temperature has risen by an average of 0.14° F. per decade. The global temperature is the
                average temperature of the Earth’s surface air and oceans.
                The global temperature is constantly chagnging due to the three factors listed above. There are many
                other factors that can play
                into climate change, but this project looks at the top three factors.

            <h2><b><u>Key Takeaways</u></b></h2>
            <p>
                There exist a few key takeways that were found in the anaylsis of the project 'CLimate Change: Factors
                and Rates'.
                It was found that when a user increases the yearly slider, the variables (CO2 Emissions, Metha
                Emissions, and Temperature)
                fluctuate over time, but have a consistency to increase. This conclusion was made based off of the data
                that was collected
                and the color scale that was used in the visualization.
            </p>

            <h2><b><u>Factor Rankings</u></b></h2>
            <p>The following list ranks how much each factor contributes to the rise in global temperature:</p>
            <h3><b><span style="color: rgb(235, 120, 54);"> 1. </span></b> CO2 Emissions</h3>
            <h3><b><span style="color: rgb(235, 120, 54);"> 2. </span></b> Methane Emissions</h3>
            <h3><b><span style="color: rgb(235, 120, 54);"> 3. </span></b>Deforestation Rates</h3>

            <p>
                During the creation of the project, a question was asked: <b>
                    <i>
                        What rate is the temperature rising due to the following factors: CO2 emissions,
                        methane emissions, and deforestation?
                    </i>
                </b> This question was answered by the creation of the line chart. The line chart shows the rate of the
                temperature
                rising over time. The line chart also shows the rate of the CO2 emissions, methane emissions, and
                deforestation over time. The line chart shows that the rate of the temperature
                rising is increasing at a faster rate than the CO2 emissions, methane emissions, and deforestation. This
                conclusion was made based off of the data that was collected.
